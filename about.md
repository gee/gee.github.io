Hi there! I'm Peter.

I wrote my first line of code when I was eight, and I've loved it ever since. Since then I've created games, desktop apps, databases, macros, websites, web crawlers, trading algorithms–whatever piques my curiosity, really. I'm fascinated by interesting problems, and I enjoy writing code to solve them. I'm currently majoring in computer science at the [University of Northwestern – St. Paul](https://unwsp.edu/), and I'll graduate later this year.
