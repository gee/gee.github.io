A friend of mine who had interviewed at [U.S. Bank](https://www.usbank.com/) the year before didn't like what he saw. He had gotten an offer from them, but his impression was that they used outdated technology, outsourced a lot of development to India, and didn't pay well compared to other internships. Needless to say, my first impression of U.S. Bank's program wasn't good. I had already decided not to turn down any interviews, though, so I accepted when they contacted me for a phone interview with a campus relations manager.

Questions asked included:

* Why did you choose this program?
* Give an example of a team project that did not go as expected.
* Tell me a time when you explained the technical details of a project and what the end result was.
* When did you have a difficult conversation and how did you prepare for it?
* Give an example of when you had to do something you had never done before.
* Give an example of using a technical tool or language to enhance a project.
* Give an example of feedback you got and how you adjusted based on it.
* What was a potentially significant problem that came up and what steps did you take to resolve it?

The interview lasted 19 minutes. I learned it would be a 10-week internship starting on June 3. Each intern is assigned a mentor from a different department. My interviewer told me they would finish phone interviews that week, present candidates to HR the following week, and get back to me about a 30-minute interview in two weeks.

Sure enough, they contacted me a couple of weeks later about an onsite interview. The day of the interview, they emailed me to let me know that the interview was switched to [WebEx](https://www.webex.com/) instead of being onsite.

Questions asked included:

* Why do you want to work here?
* Tell me about [Beginnings]({% link _projects/beginnings.md %}).
* What's an interesting technology problem you solved?
* What experience do you have with SQL?
* Tell me about [Northwestern's](https://unwsp.edu/) competition that you won.
* What interests you about information security?
* What change management do you use for Beginnings?

The interviewer this time around was a developer. He spent more time talking about the internship program than asking me questions. He said they were recruiting for an agile team with 6 members. Their focus is Java and SQL, and they work with a database containing 400 tables. They dress business casual and are becoming less formal over time. They used to have 1-2 hour meetings but now do 15-20 minute daily stand ups.

I followed up with them a couple weeks later, and they said they hadn't made a decision yet. They ended up leaving me a message saying they'd chosen another candidate. A few weeks after that they told me a new position had opened up, and they wanted to know if I was still interested. I wasn't, as I had already received offers from several companies where I'd rather work.
