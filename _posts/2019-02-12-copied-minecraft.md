title: You Copied Minecraft!

A common remark I hear when someone first plays Beginnings is that we copied Minecraft. It's true there are similarities; I even describe our game as being similar to Minecraft. Despite this, similarity does not imply copying.

### We had survival gameplay first.

[As discussed previously](/2019/01/22/history-beginnings/), Beginnings is just one part of a family of games I call The Survival Series. The first of these, Survival 101, was released in June 2009. Minecraft didn't release its [first survival version](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Survival_Test) until September 2009.

Thus, Survival 101 included many features that are today associated with Minecraft before Minecraft itself did. For everything we've kept the same since 101, we clearly didn't copy Minecraft.

### There are core gameplay differences.

Even if The Survival Series had been created after Minecraft added a survival mode, it would still not be fair to claim that Beginnings is a Minecraft clone. The most important reason for this is that playing the two games feels fundamentally different.

[According to the Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Minecraft_Wiki), Minecraft is a "sandbox construction game." It's about being able to gather resources ("mine") and create anything from those resources ("craft"). It is not originally a survival game. Stripped to its core, it's about shaping the world around you, not about surviving. Most of the survival in Minecraft becomes trivial anyway once you acquire sufficient resources.

In contrast, there are no game modes in Beginnings. There is only survival. Surviving never becomes trivial because there will always be the threat of other players. There are also many permanent structures in Beginnings such as mountains and oceans. Compared to Minecraft, Beginnings has less emphasis on sandbox gameplay and more emphasis on survival gameplay.

So no, we didn't copy Minecraft.
