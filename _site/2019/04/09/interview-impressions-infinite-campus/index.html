  <p><a href="https://www.infinitecampus.com/">Infinite Campus</a> is the only company where I’ve interviewed that had no phone or online screening step. We went straight to an onsite interview. When the time came, one of my interviewers arrived 15 minutes late, and the other arrived 25 minutes late. They pulled up my resume on a phone and then squinted as they tried read its contents. I was caught off guard by the format of the interview: 30 minutes with the first 2 interviewers and then 30 minutes with a solo interviewer. I had been told I would only be interviewing with the hiring manager. When I casually mentioned how I hadn’t expected this, my interviewer acted offended, as though I had no right to question how they do things.</p>

<p>I didn’t keep a list of questions, but I noted 2 that I wanted to be more prepared for in the future. One interviewer asked, “What do you want to get out of working here besides real world experience?” This shouldn’t be a difficult question, but real world experience was by far the biggest thing I wanted to get out of working an internship, and I hadn’t thought about alternative answers. Another asked, “What are the differences between C++ and Java at the compiler level?” I answered by explaining general differences between the 2 languages, but I should have specifically addressed differences in how they are compiled.</p>

<p>With some of the things mentioned above in mind, Infinite Campus’s interviewing process left me feeling underwhelmed. I suspect they sensed my lack of enthusiasm as well. They were already at the bottom of my list due to the distant location from my home, and the interview sealed the deal. As a disclaimer, I’d like to point out that this was just one experience with just a few people. I have nothing negative to say about the company as a whole.</p>
