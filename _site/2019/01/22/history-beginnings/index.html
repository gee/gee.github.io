  <p>This blog seems a natural place to write about my projects. The largest of these is Beginnings, a game published on <a href="https://www.roblox.com/">Roblox</a>. In this post I’d like to go over the game’s history. If you’re more interested in the game’s current state, take a look at its <a href="/projects/beginnings/">project page</a>.</p>

<p>In June 2009, David “Davidii” Nurkkala—an old friend of mine—created a game called Survival 101. I distinctly remember playing one of the earliest versions. There was a single island, and the only resources were trees and berry bushes. One day the player count spiked to over 600, securing the #1 spot on the Roblox games page. The Survival Series and its loyal community were born.</p>

<p>David went on to create Survival 202 and Survival 303 that same year. 303 became the fan favorite with plays surpassing even David’s sequels: 404 in 2010, Finale in 2011, Into the Frost in 2012, and Dominion in 2013.</p>

<p>Meanwhile many of us continued to play 303. When David shifted his focus elsewhere, he gave me permission to update the game in his stead. Several others joined the 303 development team later, and <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/480485987/Survival-303">the game receives updates to this day</a>.</p>

<p>In November 2013 I decided to make a sequel to 303. I had experience with the genre and a desire to grow the Survival Series. Thus I began work on Survival: Beginnings. My brother Nathan joined not long after. By chance David also decided to make a sequel to 303 around the same time, Survival 323.</p>

<p>Beginnings was made from the ground up in about 40 days. The day after its release it hit the #1 spot on the games page at around 3,700 players. Since its release it has been played over 2 million times. Unfortunately, because the code was written shortly before <a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2014/05/game-creation-gets-bigger-faster-and-more-lucrative-in-2014/">FilteringEnabled became an option</a>, rampant exploiters ruined hundreds of servers. This made updates feel pointless. Why make updates if they would be nullified by hordes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_kiddie">script kiddies</a>? This led us to start work on Beginnings 2.</p>

<p>Over the past few years we’ve been working on Beginnings 2 here and there. Of course we would have liked to release the game long ago, but several factors have caused delays. We have tremendous aspirations for the game, and we don’t want to release something half baked. It’s currently in Beta and benefits from testers in our community of fans. We will release the public version when we believe it’s ready.</p>
