<p>Child Evangelism Fellowship Twin Cities needed a <a href="http://www.ceftwincities.com/">new website</a>. Some key objectives included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Clearly show how people can get involved</li>
  <li>Easy access to staff timesheets</li>
  <li>A method of contacting staff</li>
  <li>A method of donating to the ministry</li>
  <li>Easy customization by multiple staff users</li>
</ul>

<p>I could have created the site from the ground up using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Because of the all-important requirement that the site must be easy for staff to modify, however, I opted to use G Suite’s Google Sites.
