    <p>Of everywhere I’ve interviewed, <a href="http://www.nexteraenergy.com/">NextEra Energy</a> had the shortest interview process. It began with a request for an online interview through <a href="https://www.hirevue.com/">HireVue</a>. This included 3 prelimary typed questions about my GPA, major, and graduation date. Following these I was asked 4 questions in which my answers would be 2-minute video recordings.</p>

    <p>I applied at <a href="https://invenshure.com/">Invenshure</a> through <a href="https://scitechmn.org/">SciTechsperience</a>. As a biotech incubator, Invenshure’s goal is to “build companies that change the world by turning hard problems into thriving businesses.” I got a phone interview scheduled with an embedded systems engineer who seemed to also be in charge of hiring interns.</p>

        Interview Impressions: U.S. Bank

    <p>A friend of mine who had interviewed at <a href="https://www.usbank.com/">U.S. Bank</a> the year before didn’t like what he saw. He had gotten an offer from them, but his impression was that they used outdated technology, outsourced a lot of development to India, and didn’t pay well compared to other internships. Needless to say, my first impression of U.S. Bank’s program wasn’t good. I had already decided not to turn down any interviews, though, so I accepted when they contacted me for a phone interview with a campus relations manager.</p>

    <p>I was introduced to <a href="https://www.prepnetwork.com/">Prep Network</a> when its CEO contacted me via my enrollment in <a href="https://scitechmn.org/">SciTechsperience</a>. Prep Network’s goal is “to be the country’s most comprehensive resource for evaluation and recruitment in high school athletics.” Having only 11 full time employees, it’s the smallest company where I’ve interviewed. We scheduled a phone interview which lasted 23 minutes.</p>

    <p>Over the course of my summer 2018 internship search I applied to around 10 companies. The only company I ended up interviewing with was the only one that reached out to me first: <a href="https://www.revtrak.com/">RevTrak</a>, a K-12 payment processing company. They most likely contacted me due to my connections with the human resources assistant and other employees through church.</p>
