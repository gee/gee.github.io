    <p>I was introduced to <a href="https://www.prepnetwork.com/">Prep Network</a> when its CEO contacted me via my enrollment in <a href="https://scitechmn.org/">SciTechsperience</a>. Prep Network’s goal is “to be the country’s most comprehensive resource for evaluation and recruitment in high school athletics.” Having only 11 full time employees, it’s the smallest company where I’ve interviewed. We scheduled a phone interview which lasted 23 minutes.</p>

    <p>Over the course of my summer 2018 internship search I applied to around 10 companies. The only company I ended up interviewing with was the only one that reached out to me first: <a href="https://www.revtrak.com/">RevTrak</a>, a K-12 payment processing company. They most likely contacted me due to my connections with the human resources assistant and other employees through church.</p>

    <p>I haven’t uploaded anything lately, so this week I’ll be writing 3 posts.</p>

<p>This particular post marks the start of a series I’m calling <em>Interview Impressions</em>. This will be a set of around 10 posts in which I’ll summarize my interactions with and impressions of companies where I interviewed. With the exception of RevTrak, where I interviewed over a year ago, the interviews took place between late November 2018 and early January 2019.</p>

<p>So why write this series?</p>

        Basic Microtransaction Categories

    <p>Monetization is one of the most controversial topics in gaming today. Should a game have a single upfront cost? Should it be free-to-play? What about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemium">freemium</a>? Are loot boxes ethical? What should we sell, and what should be off limits? Should a game’s monetization scheme depend on its genre?</p>

<p>These questions are particularly relevant for competitive online games with plenty of interaction between players. Since <a href="/projects/beginnings/">Beginnings</a> falls under that description this is a topic I’ve put a lot of thought into. In our case we originally had no intentions of selling anything because we had no idea the game would become popular. Since then we’ve adopted a freemium model. We offer the vast majority of the game for free, but certain additional features or customizations are for sale. It seems to me that there are 4 basic categories that these kinds of microtransactions can be split into: power, mechanic, convenience, and cosmetic.</p>

    <p>A common remark I hear when someone first plays Beginnings is that we copied Minecraft. It’s true there are similarities; I even describe our game as being similar to Minecraft. Despite this, similarity does not imply copying.</p>
