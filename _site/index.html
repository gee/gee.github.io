    <p>Over the course of my summer 2018 internship search I applied to around 10 companies. The only company I ended up interviewing with was the only one that reached out to me first: <a href="https://www.revtrak.com/">RevTrak</a>, a K-12 payment processing company. They most likely contacted me due to my connections with the human resources assistant and other employees through church.</p>

    <p>I haven’t uploaded anything lately, so this week I’ll be writing 3 posts.</p>

<p>This particular post marks the start of a series I’m calling <em>Interview Impressions</em>. This will be a set of around 10 posts in which I’ll summarize my interactions with and impressions of companies where I interviewed. With the exception of RevTrak, where I interviewed over a year ago, the interviews took place between late November 2018 and early January 2019.</p>

<p>So why write this series?</p>

        Basic Microtransaction Categories

    <p>Monetization is one of the most controversial topics in gaming today. Should a game have a single upfront cost? Should it be free-to-play? What about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemium">freemium</a>? Are loot boxes ethical? What should we sell, and what should be off limits? Should a game’s monetization scheme depend on its genre?</p>

<p>These questions are particularly relevant for competitive online games with plenty of interaction between players. Since <a href="/projects/beginnings/">Beginnings</a> falls under that description this is a topic I’ve put a lot of thought into. In our case we originally had no intentions of selling anything because we had no idea the game would become popular. Since then we’ve adopted a freemium model. We offer the vast majority of the game for free, but certain additional features or customizations are for sale. It seems to me that there are 4 basic categories that these kinds of microtransactions can be split into: power, mechanic, convenience, and cosmetic.</p>

    <p>A common remark I hear when someone first plays Beginnings is that we copied Minecraft. It’s true there are similarities; I even describe our game as being similar to Minecraft. Despite this, similarity does not imply copying.</p>

    <p>This semester I have two main focuses: my internship and my senior project. Last month I started an internship at <a href="https://invenshure.com/">Invenshure</a> — more on that in a future post. This month I’m starting on my senior project. Although my advisor Dr. Zderad allows great flexibility in choosing a topic, the focus should be on actually creating something. Research is secondary for this particular project.</p>

<p>Naturally the first step is choosing a topic, and over the past couple months I’ve thought through a few ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>3D Object Fitting Algorithm (C++)</li>
  <li>Bible Memory Mobile App (Java)</li>
  <li>Stock Market Prediction (Python)</li>
  <li>Beginnings 2 (Lua)</li>
</ul>
