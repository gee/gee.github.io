        Interview Impressions: Infinite Campus

    <p><a href="https://www.infinitecampus.com/">Infinite Campus</a> is the only company where I’ve interviewed that had no phone or online screening step. We went straight to an onsite interview. When the time came, one of my interviewers arrived 15 minutes late, and the other arrived 25 minutes late. They pulled up my resume on a phone and then squinted as they tried read its contents. I was caught off guard by the format of the interview: 30 minutes with the first 2 interviewers and then 30 minutes with a solo interviewer. I had been told I would only be interviewing with the hiring manager. When I casually mentioned how I hadn’t expected this, my interviewer acted offended, as though I had no right to question how they do things.</p>

    <p>Of everywhere I’ve interviewed, <a href="http://www.nexteraenergy.com/">NextEra Energy</a> had the shortest interview process. It began with a request for an online interview through <a href="https://www.hirevue.com/">HireVue</a>. This included 3 prelimary typed questions about my GPA, major, and graduation date. Following these I was asked 4 questions in which my answers would be 2-minute video recordings.</p>

    <p>I applied at <a href="https://invenshure.com/">Invenshure</a> through <a href="https://scitechmn.org/">SciTechsperience</a>. As a biotech incubator, Invenshure’s goal is to “build companies that change the world by turning hard problems into thriving businesses.” I got a phone interview scheduled with an embedded systems engineer who seemed to also be in charge of hiring interns.</p>

        Interview Impressions: U.S. Bank

    <img src="/public/images/interview-impressions-us-bank-logo.jpg">

    <p>A friend of mine who had interviewed at <a href="https://www.usbank.com/">U.S. Bank</a> the year before didn’t like what he saw. He had gotten an offer from them, but his impression was that they used outdated technology, outsourced a lot of development to India, and didn’t pay well compared to other internships. Needless to say, my first impression of U.S. Bank’s program wasn’t good. I had already decided not to turn down any interviews, though, so I accepted when they contacted me for a phone interview with a campus relations manager.</p>

    <p>I was introduced to <a href="https://www.prepnetwork.com/">Prep Network</a> when its CEO contacted me via my enrollment in <a href="https://scitechmn.org/">SciTechsperience</a>. Prep Network’s goal is “to be the country’s most comprehensive resource for evaluation and recruitment in high school athletics.” Having only 11 full time employees, it’s the smallest company where I’ve interviewed. We scheduled a phone interview which lasted 23 minutes.</p>
