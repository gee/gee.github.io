"Autumn" is a <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/index.shtml">NetLogo</a> computer model that allows users to adjust climate conditions and pre-existing conditions for a tree in order to predict the natural phenomena of leaves changing color and falling. My team and I began by tweaking parameters to achieve specific colors: green, yellow, red, and orange.

* Chlorophyll causes the green color in leaves. Water and sunlight combine to make chlorophyll, but low temperatures or intense sunlight kill chlorophyll.
* Carotene causes the yellow color in leaves. Carotene remains consistent, but it is usually masked by high levels of chlorophyll.
* Anthocyanins cause the red color in leaves. Sugar and water combine to form anthocyanins, but only in cold weather.
* If a leaf lacks chlorophyll and its carotene and anthocyanin levels are roughly similar, it will be orange.

We further adjusted the model in order to learn about the effects of various factors, including:

* Coloration strictness
* Sugar levels
* Drastic climate changes

We concluded with a written report and in-class presentation for MAT4337 Mathematical Models and Apps.
