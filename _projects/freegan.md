One day at the Child Evangelism Fellowship Twin Cities office I was assigned the task of manually gathering data from the United States Census Bureau's <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/">American Fact Finder</a>. It seemed reasonable enough until I realized we needed demographic studies for Hennepin County's 300 census tracts at minimum, and ideally we'd have studies for all of Minnesota's 1,336 tracts. Each study required several minutes to make. It became clear that doing the work manually would cost days, even weeks of monotonous work. Worse, the process would need to be repeated whenever new data emerged. There had to be a better solution!
