Two classmates and I formed a team to develop this basic desktop application in Visual Basic .NET. One key requirement was that it must interact with a database. Thus, we included functionality both to add games and delete them. Furthermore, we were required to handle user input delicately; users were not allowed to enter a name in the "Metascore" column for example.

We concluded with a written report and in-class presentation for COS2115 Computer Software Development.
