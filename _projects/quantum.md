This class assignment required that I do considerable research into a relevant computer security topic. Quantum encryption seemed interesting. In the presentation I discussed topics such as:

* Bits v. qubits
* Classical v. quantum cryptography
* Quantum v. post-quantum cryptography
* Quantum key distribution (QKD)
* China's quantum satellite Micius
* Quantum computing
* Why it's important

Here's a brief outline of quantum cryptography's history:

* 1927 Heisenberg: uncertainty principle
* 1982 Wootters, Zurek, and Dieks: no-cloning theorem
* 1983 Wiesner: quantum cryptography
* 1984 Bennett and Brassard: BB84
* 1991 Ekert: E91
* 1994 Shor: Shorâ€™s algorithm

I turned in a paper and gave the in-class presentation for COS3369 Computer Security Fundamentals.
