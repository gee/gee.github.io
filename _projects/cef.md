Child Evangelism Fellowship Twin Cities needed a [new website](http://www.ceftwincities.com/). Some key objectives included:

* Clearly show how people can get involved
* Easy access to staff timesheets
* A method of contacting staff
* A method of donating to the ministry
* Easy customization by multiple staff users

I could have created the site from the ground up using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Because of the all-important requirement that the site must be easy for staff to modify, however, I opted to use G Suite's Google Sites. As a result, the office no longer needed a web developer to make changes; staff could do it themselves instead.
