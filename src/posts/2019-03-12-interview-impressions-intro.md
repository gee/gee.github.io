I haven't uploaded anything lately, so this week I'll be writing 3 posts.

This particular post marks the start of a series I'm calling *Interview Impressions*. This will be a set of around 10 posts in which I'll summarize my interactions with and impressions of companies where I interviewed. With the exception of RevTrak, where I interviewed over a year ago, the interviews took place between late November 2018 and early January 2019.

So why write this series?

My search for a summer 2018 internship was halfhearted. There were several other things I wanted to do with my summer, and although I had some job experience, I really didn't have any job *search* experience. I look back on that period thankful for all the lessons I learned that allowed me to be much more successful the second time around.

Initially the most daunting part of the job search process was interviewing. I didn't know what to expect. If I would have had access to a series of posts that explained how various companies conducted their software developer interviews, I would have felt much more prepared. It would have given me concrete context instead of being left with vague preconceptions.

Thus, I hope this series helps anyone who finds themselves in a similar place of not knowing what to expect. Of course, it will also serve as a record of history that I'll be able to look back on years from now.
